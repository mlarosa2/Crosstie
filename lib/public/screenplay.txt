EXT - DAIRY FARM- DAY
The modest dairy farm in the countryside of Nancy, France (what the
French call cow country).
We Read a SUBTITLE in the sky above the farm house;

CHAPTER ONE

"ONCE UPON A TIME IN...

NAZI OCCUPIED FRANCE"
This SUBTITLE disappears, and is replaced by another one;

"1941
One year into the German
occupation of France".
The farm consists of a house, small barn, and twelve cows spread
about.
The owner of the property, a bull of a man FRENCH FARMER, brings a axe
up and down on A tree stump blemishing his property. However simply by
sight, you'd never know if he's been beating at this stump for the last
year, or just started today.

JULIE
One of his three pretty teenage daughters, is hanging up laundry on
the clothes line. As she hangs up a white bed sheet, she hears a
noise, moving the sheet aside she see's;

JULIE'S POV:
A Nazi town car convertible, with two little nazi flags attached to
the hood, a NAZI SOLDIER behind the wheel, a NAZI OFFICER alone in the
back seat, following TWO OTHER NAZI SOLDIERS on motorcycles, coming up
over the hill on the country road leading to their farm.

JULIE
Pappa.
The French Farmer sinks his axe in the stump, looks over his shoulder,
and see's the Germans approaching.
The FARMERS WIFE, CHARLOTTE comes to the doorway of their home,
followed by her TWO OTHER TEENAGE DAUGHTERS, and see the Germans
approaching.
The Farmer yells to his family in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;

FARMER
Go back inside and shut the door.









IL

FARMER
(to Julie)
Julie, get me some water from the pump
to wash up with, then get inside with
your mother.
The young lady runs to the water pump by the house. She picks up a
basin, and begins pumping, after a few pumps, water comes out
splashing into the basin.
The French Farmer sits down on the stump he was previously chopping
away at, pulls a handkerchief from his pocket, wipes sweat from off
his face, and waits for the Nazi convoy to arrive. After living for
a year with the sword of Damocles suspended over his head, this may
very well be the end.
Julie finishes filling the water basin, and places it on the window
sill.

JULIE
Ready Pappa.

FARMER
Thank you darling, now go inside and
take care of your mother. Don't run.
Julie walks inside the farm house and closes the door behind her.
As her father stands up from his stump, and moves over to the window
sill with the water basin...
.The SOUND of the ENGINES of the two motorcycles and car get LOUDER.
The Farmer SPLASHES water from the basin on his face and down his
front. He takes a towel off a nail, and wipes the excess water from
his face and chest, as he watches the two motorcycles, the one
automobile, and the four representatives of the National Socialist
Party come to a halt on his property.
We don't move into them, but keep observing them from a distance, like
the Farmer.
The TWO NAZI MOTORCYCLIST are off their bikes, and standing at
attention next to them.
The NAZI DRIVER has walked around the automobile, and opened the door
for his superior.
The NAZI OFFICER says to The Driver in UNSUBTITLED GERMAN;

NAZI OFFICER
This is the property of Perrier LaPadite?

NAZI DRIVER
Yes heer Colonel.
The Nazi officer climbs out of the back the vehicle, carrying
in his left hand
n d

OFFICER
Herman, until I summon you, I am to be
left alone.

NAZI DRIVER
As you wish Heer Col.
The S.S. COLONEL yells to The Farmer in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;

NAZI OFFICER
Is this the property of Perrier LaPadite?

FARMER
I am Perrier LaPadite.
The S.S. Colonel crosses the distance between them with long strides,
and says in French with a smile on his face;

NAZI OFFICER
It is a pleasure to meet you Monsieur
LaPadite, I am Colonel Hans Landa of
the S.S.
COLONEL.HANS LANDA offers the French Farmer PERRIER LAPADITE his hand.
The Frenchman takes the German hand in his and shakes it.

PERRIER
How may I help you?

COL LANDA
I was hoping you could invite me inside
your home and we may have a discussion.

INT - LAPADITE FARM HOUSE - DAY
The door to the farm house swings open, andtheaFarmer gesturestfor
the S.S. COL to enter. Removing his grey S.S. cap,
inside the Frenchman's home.
Col Landa is immediately greeted with the sight of the Farmers wife,
and three pretty daughters standing together in the kitchen, smiling
in his direction.
The Farmer enters behind him, closing the door.
